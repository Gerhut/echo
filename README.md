# Echo

This is a web app bulit for celebrating the May 20th (Which means 'I Love You' in Chinese) with my girl friend. ;P
It was inspired by the message effect named *echo* in iMessage.

Just make your fun.

## DEMO

[https://iwillwen.github.io/echo/](https://iwillwen.github.io/echo/)

## Usage

Clone this project and deploy it to any static server like [now.sh](now.sh).

```bash
$ git clone github.com/iwillwen/echo
$ cd echo
$ now
```

Browse the website and click(or press space/enter).

### Custom messages

You can change the messages to show, just concat them with hash symbol(`#`) and
put the uri-ecnoded (like using encodeURIComponent) string into the hash of the url.
Just like https://iwillwen.github.io/echo/#MessageOne#MessageTwo#MessageThree.
Because the unicode are supported, so emoji is good.

Maybe there is a good idea that showing 'I Love You' in some different languages. hmm

## Finally

Of course, this is just a tiny thing only costed 30 mins and 100+ lines of code.
If you are really want to make your women happy. I think a GUCCI is the perfect choice.
